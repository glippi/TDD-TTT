## Is possible to fully drive the production code of a UI by tests?

The goal of this repository is to answer this question. 
Please note that I focused mainly on the TDD routine, trying to see how it fits
with the frontend, so the production code, in terms of react best practices and
state management, isn't as good as I would like. But, again, this isn't the
scope of the project.

And, by the way, it seems really possible to drive UI code from tests!

### Available Scripts

As this project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, you can use all the available scripts:

`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
